# A-Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting

This project aims to analyze and forecast the sales of a major supermarket retailer, using time series data to assess the performance of its stores.

The objective is to create a model that can properly forecast future sales using the thousands of products sold at different supermarket locations in order to assist the management of the store in formulating inventory and sales plans. I will use sales forecasting to extrapolate future sales levels for the company using historical sales data because sales over the past four years have generated a lot of data. The intention is to support business managers in making forecasts about the future based on this information, which has been kept on file for a set period of time following the event or after it occurred. As part of this research, I will build models using historical analysis, formulate scientific hypotheses based on time-stamped historical data and then utilize those models to make observations and direct strategic decision-making in the future. In order to enhance operations and ultimately sales, we would like to assist management in gaining some insights from their data.
